    <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha
         clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later became an international criminal after 
         murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards 
         joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought
          him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja including Sasuke who sought to avenge 
          their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more 
          complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother 
          and village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
