        <p>Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen
             Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in
              72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television 
              series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 
              episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the 
              series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009.
               Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered
                in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. 
                The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, 
                airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult
                 Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over 
                 from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on 
                 Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime series 
                 on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes,
                  and ended on March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, 
                  Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). 
                  Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards 
                  developed by several companies.
